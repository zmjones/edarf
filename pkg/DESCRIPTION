Title: Exploratory Data Analysis using Random Forests
Description: Functions useful for exploratory data analysis
    using random forests which can be used to compute multivariate partial
    dependence, observation, class, and variable-wise marginal and joint permutation
    importance as well as observation-specific measures of distance 
    (supervised or unsupervised). All of the aforementioned functions are
    accompanied by 'ggplot2' plotting functions.
